## About this Project

This application allows users to manage course records. Built with a focus on simplicity, it has functionalities to add, search, and delete courses.
The application handles course details such as subject, course number (formatted as three-digit, zero-padded integer), and description. And it prevents the addition of duplicate courses and validates course numbers.
